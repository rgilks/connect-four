## AI System

The game features a sophisticated AI system with multiple opponents to choose from:

- **Classic AI**: Traditional minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Fast and reliable.
- **ML AI**: Neural network trained on genetic algorithm data. Balanced performance.
- **Self-Play AI**: Advanced neural network trained through self-play with MCTS exploration. Most sophisticated.

### AI Selection Interface

Players can select their preferred AI opponent from a beautiful card-based interface that shows:

- AI type and description
- Performance characteristics
- Visual indicators for selection

### Genetic Algorithm Evolution

The AI parameters are evolved using genetic algorithms:

```bash
# Run genetic parameter evolution
npm run evolve:genetic-params

# Plot evolution results
python scripts/plot_evolution.py evolution_params_20241201_143022.csv
```

### Self-Play Training

Advanced AI models are trained through self-play:

```bash
# Quick self-play training (100 games, 10 epochs)
npm run train:self-play:quick

# Standard self-play training (1000 games, 50 epochs)
npm run train:self-play
```

### Simple ML Training

Lightweight neural networks for fast, efficient AI:

```bash
# Train basic simple model (20 epochs, 500 games)
python3 ml/scripts/simple_train.py --epochs 20 --num-games 500

# Train enhanced simple model (50 epochs, 1000 games)
python3 ml/scripts/simple_train.py --epochs 50 --num-games 1000 --batch-size 64 --learning-rate 0.0005 --output simple_model_enhanced.json
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Trained Models (July 2025)

- **Simple Model**: 50 epochs, 1000 games, 64 batch size
- **Enhanced Model**: 50 epochs, 1000 games, 64 batch size, 0.0005 learning rate
- **Training Time**: ~2.5 seconds for enhanced model
- **Model Size**: 297KB (67x smaller than complex models)
- **Integration**: Successfully integrated with WASM AI system
