## Recommendations

- Heuristic shows moderate performance (55.4% avg win rate), consider further training
- Random is very fast (0.0ms/move) and suitable for real-time play
- Use EMM-Depth3 for best performance/speed balance
- Use Random AI for baseline testing
- Use Heuristic AI for educational purposes
