## Speed Analysis

| AI        | ms/move | Speed     |
| --------- | ------- | --------- |
| Random    | 0.0     | Very Fast |
| MM-Depth1 | 0.0     | Very Fast |
| Heuristic | 0.0     | Very Fast |
| ML-Simple | 0.4     | Very Fast |

## Recommendations

- ML-Simple shows excellent performance (71.9% avg win rate) and is ready for production
- Random is very fast (0.0ms/move) and suitable for real-time play
- Use MM-Depth3 for best performance/speed balance
- Use Random AI for baseline testing
- Use Heuristic AI for educational purposes

## Recent Fixes

### Genetic Parameters Issue (July 2025)

**Problem**: The app was using incomplete fallback genetic parameters when the evolved.json file failed to load, causing inconsistent AI performance.

**Solution**: Updated the WASM AI service to use complete default genetic parameters that match the Rust `GeneticParams::default()` implementation.

**Impact**:

- All AI types now use consistent genetic parameters
- Matrix test results are now reliable and reproducible
- Both Classic AI and ML AI are properly configured

**Files Changed**:

- `src/lib/wasm-ai-service.ts`: Fixed genetic parameters fallback
