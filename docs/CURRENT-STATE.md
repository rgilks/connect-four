# Current State Summary

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue: WASM AI Not Integrated

The Connect Four game has a **sophisticated Rust/WASM AI system** that has been built but is **NOT being used**. Instead, the game runs on a basic JavaScript heuristic AI.

## What's Currently Active

### Game AI (JavaScript)

- **Location**: `src/lib/game-logic.ts`
- **Algorithm**: Simple heuristic
- **Strategy**:
  1. Look for winning moves
  2. Block opponent wins
  3. Prefer center columns (3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 0, 6)
  4. Fallback to random
- **Performance**: Basic play, ~1ms per move

## What's Built But Not Used

### Rust/WASM AI System

- **Location**: `worker/rust_ai_core/src/`
- **Features**:
  - Classic AI (minimax with alpha-beta pruning)
  - ML AI (neural networks)
  - Genetic parameter optimization
  - Transposition tables
- **Performance**: 60+ games/second, competitive play
- **Build System**: WASM compilation working, files in `public/wasm/`

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Create WASM Integration Service

**File**: `src/lib/wasm-ai-service.ts`

- Load WASM module
- Handle AI move calculations
- Provide fallback to JavaScript AI

### 2. Update Game Logic

**File**: `src/lib/game-logic.ts`

- Replace JavaScript AI with WASM AI
- Maintain same interface
- Add error handling

### 3. Test Integration

- Verify WASM AI loads correctly
- Test performance and functionality
- Ensure fallback mechanisms work

## Impact

### Current State

- Game works but AI is very basic
- Players can easily beat the AI
- No advanced features like move analysis

### After Integration

- Much stronger AI opponent
- Advanced features (move analysis, AI selection)
- Competitive gameplay experience

## Documentation

- **Integration Plan**: [WASM-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md](./WASM-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md)
- **AI System Details**: [AI-SYSTEM.md](./AI-SYSTEM.md)
- **TODO List**: [TODO.md](./TODO.md)

## Priority

This is the **highest priority** issue. The sophisticated AI system represents significant development effort and should be integrated to provide the intended gameplay experience.
