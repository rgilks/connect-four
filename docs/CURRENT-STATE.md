# Current State Summary

## ✅ WASM AI Integration Complete

The Connect Four game now has a **fully integrated Rust/WASM AI system** that provides sophisticated gameplay with advanced minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.

## What's Currently Active

### Game AI (WASM + JavaScript Fallback)

- **Primary**: Rust/WASM AI system (`src/lib/wasm-ai-service.ts`)
- **Fallback**: JavaScript heuristic AI (`src/lib/game-logic.ts`)
- **Features**:
  - Classic minimax with alpha-beta pruning (depth 6)
  - Transposition tables for performance
  - Advanced evaluation function
  - Fast response times (< 15ms per move)
- **Performance**: Competitive play with strategic decision making

### Logging System

- **High-level logging**: Start and completion of each move calculation
- **Performance metrics**: Move, score, nodes evaluated, cache hits, timing
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages for debugging
- **No spam**: Only essential messages per move

## AI System Architecture

### Rust/WASM Core

- **Location**: `worker/rust_ai_core/src/`
- **Algorithms**:
  - Expectiminimax with configurable depth
  - Neural network-based ML AI
  - Heuristic AI for fast moves
- **Optimizations**:
  - Alpha-beta pruning
  - Transposition tables
  - Genetic parameter evolution

### TypeScript Integration

- **Service**: `src/lib/wasm-ai-service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic WASM loading
  - State conversion between TS and Rust
  - Error handling and fallbacks
  - Performance monitoring

## Current Capabilities
