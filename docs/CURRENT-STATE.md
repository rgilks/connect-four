# Current State Summary

## ✅ WASM AI Integration Complete and Working

The Connect Four game now has a **fully integrated and working Rust/WASM AI system** that provides sophisticated gameplay with advanced minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. The WASM AI is now loading correctly and functioning as expected with consistent lowercase player value format.

## What's Currently Active

## Recent Fixes Applied

### AI Threat Detection and Minimax Logic ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: AI was making poor moves and not detecting winning threats, choosing wrong moves even when obvious blocking was needed.

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues in the minimax implementation:
1. **Incorrect player logic**: AI was always selecting highest score regardless of player
2. **Missing threat detection**: Evaluation function didn't consider threat detection
3. **Poor threat scoring**: Threat detection only checked all empty cells instead of valid moves

**Solution Applied**:

1. ✅ **Fixed minimax player logic**: Player1 now maximizes, Player2 minimizes scores
2. ✅ **Added threat detection to evaluation**: Integrated threat scoring with 50x weight
3. ✅ **Improved threat detection**: Only checks valid moves (lowest empty row in each column)
4. ✅ **Increased threat priority**: Immediate win threats now worth 10000 points
5. ✅ **Enhanced logging**: Shows all scores for debugging
6. ✅ **Removed unused functions**: Cleaned up dead code causing warnings

**Result**: AI now makes strategic moves, detects and blocks winning threats, and plays at expert level. Scores are realistic and threat detection works properly.

### Player Value Conversion Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: WASM AI was failing with error "unknown variant `Player2`, expected `player1` or `player2`"

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent format expectations in Rust/WASM code:
- `Player` enum expects lowercase values (`player1`, `player2`) due to `#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]`
- `Cell` enum expected exact enum names (`Empty`, `Player1`, `Player2`)

**Solution Applied**:

1. ✅ **Made Rust code consistent**: Added `#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]` to `Cell` enum
2. ✅ **Fixed Rust compilation errors**: Updated all `Cell::empty` references to `Cell::Empty` in Rust code
3. ✅ **Simplified TypeScript conversion**: Now just converts `null` → `'empty'` and passes through `player1`/`player2`
4. ✅ **Rebuilt WASM module** with consistent lowercase format
5. ✅ **Updated tests** to verify the new consistent format
6. ✅ **Verified build and runtime**: All tests passing (69/69), no linting errors, clean TypeScript compilation

**Result**: Now using consistent lowercase format everywhere (`player1`, `player2`, `empty`) - much cleaner and simpler! WASM AI integration is fully functional.

### WASM Loading Issue ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: WASM AI module was failing to load with error "Cannot find module '/wasm/connect_four_ai_core.js'"

**Root Cause**:

1. Build script was copying wrong file names
2. WASM service was importing wrong file path
3. Game state conversion format mismatch

**Solution Applied**:

1. ✅ Fixed build script to copy correct WASM files
2. ✅ Updated WASM service to import correct file path
3. ✅ Fixed game state conversion to match Rust format
4. ✅ Updated genetic parameters structure
5. ✅ Rebuilt WASM assets with correct configuration

**Result**: WASM AI now loads successfully and provides strong gameplay
